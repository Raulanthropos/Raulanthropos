Hi! My name is Ioannis!
========================================================================================================================================

I am a full-stack developer.
--------------------

In 2020, as the pandemic took hold and I found myself without work in the humanitarian aid field, I turned to coding as a way to channel my energy and creativity. Despite the challenges posed by the new era, I persisted in my studies, balancing my work alongside. Eventually in 2022, I fully committed to web development and related technologies. Through coding, I found renewed purpose and excitement, constantly pushing myself to learn more and overcome obstacles. I am now on a path of continuous learning and growth, feeling rejuvenated and eagerly anticipating the challenges to come.
